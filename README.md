# Crop-Recommendation-using-weather-and-soil-content
Crop recommendation is a critical task for agricultural productivity, and weather and soil conditions play a significant role in determining the suitable crop to grow. In this project, an object-oriented approach is used to develop a crop recommendation system that considers the weather and soil content of a particular region.
